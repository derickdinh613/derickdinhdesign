      <p>Logos are where my passion for branding started. Creating logos and an image for a person or a company are something I enjoy because I get to know to the person/company and eventually build an image off of who they are.</p>

        <p>Nocturnal was created and founded in the fall of 2016 and with it, it’s first logo.</p>

        <p>LAs time went on it was realized that Nocturnal’s logo didn’t feel like a logo that aligned with an E-sports brand, shortly after the second iteration of the Nocturnal logo was created.</p>

        <p>I’m sure you’re getting tired of seeing Nocturnal logos by now! Don’t worry this is the last one on this page. Nocturnal wanted a fresh logo, with a fiercer looking logo.</p>

        <p>My first commissioned logo, made for a streamer friend Beamtv. The concept behind it was the line coming out of the B was a beam, zippin’ around!</p>

        <p>My first logo EVER, this piece was for an old gaming youtube channel in which I used to be a part of. Careless gaming, adding the bomb in the middle was key as it represented our carelessness in video games usually resulting in explosions.</p>
